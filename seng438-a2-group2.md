# 1 Introduction

This test design will cover 5 methods from org.jfree.data.Range and 5 methods from org.jfree.data.DataUtilities. The 5 methods from the range class are: Constrain, Contains, Equals, getLowerBound and getLength and the 5 methods from DataUtilities are calculateColumnTotal, calculateRowTotal, createNumberArray, createNumberArray2D and 	getCumulativePercentages. The test will make sure that the methods in the Range and DataUtilities class behave as expected and according to its requirements. The testing will focus on black-box testing techniques, such as equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. 
# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Our unit testing strategy is defined using black-box testing principles that focus on testing the software functionality against its specifications and requirements and not the implementation inside. Since we are just given the method requirements, the most appropriate strategy to adopt is black-box testing. The strategy guarantees the methods satisfy the required output for all valid inputs, boundary cases, and edge cases.

Equivalence Partitioning:
The input domain of every method is divided into equivalence classes with each equivalence class being a group of inputs which must produce the same output. For example, in the case of the constrain method in Range class, the input domain is divided into three equivalence classes: values within the range, values less than the lower bound, and values more than the upper bound. Each equivalence class is also tested with at least one representative input to ensure that the method behaves properly for that class.

Boundary:
Boundary values are specific inputs on the edges of the input range. For example, for the contains method, boundary values are the lower bound (5.0) and the upper bound (10.0). Testing boundary values ensures that the method works as expected for edge cases, i.e., values precisely on the lower or upper bounds.

Test Cases:
Test cases are designed to cover all equivalence classes and boundary values. Each test case includes:
  - Input: A specific value or object to be passed to the method.
  - Expected Output: The expected result based on the requirements.
  - Actual Output: The result produced by the method during testing and pass/fail.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We divided the work into pairs where one pair worked on the Range and DataUtilities class respectively. Each pair came up with a test plan and then looked over each other to give feedback and add before coding the tests. Upon completion of the test plan, each pair coded the tests and used pair programming in order to implement successfully. Once completed each pair reviewed the others test code and finalized the tests.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Upon starting the lab we had challenges setting up eclipse and making sure we followed the instructions. Furthermore when writing the test code, using jMock was somewhat challenging due to not using it before, but upon looking into it we figured it out. This lab allowed us to learn more about implementing JUnit tests based on method specifications. We were able to learn how to come up with effective test plans and take advantage of black box testing.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

If the lab gave us some instructions on how to download and setup Eclipse, that would have helped a lot.
